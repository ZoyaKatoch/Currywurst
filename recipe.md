1. Heat the oil in a small saucepan and cook the onions just until soft and translucent. Do not brown them. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. Add the curry powder, paprika, cloves and cinnamon and cook for 30 seconds. Add all remaining ingredients and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium, cover and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Use an immersion blender or transfer to a blender and puree until smooth.  Let the mixture cool completely and then refrigerate for a day before using to allow time for the flavors to meld.  

2. Makes 1 1/2 cups.  The curry ketchup will keep for up to a month in the fridge.

3. HOW TO MAKE CURRYWURST:

4. If the sausages are not pre-cooked, first poach them in lightly simmering water.  The next step is to grill/fry them to finish them off.  
You can either grill or pan-fry the sausages.
The important thing is to cook them until they develop a thick and crispy browned outer crust.  (So if you're pan-frying, be sure to use enough oil.)  Some curry wurst stands also cut vertical slits along the currywurst to prevent them from bursting open while cooking and then the sausages are sliced along the lines into bite-sized chunks before serving.

5. To serve, slice the wursts vertically into bite-sized pieces, top with some curry ketchup, and sprinkle with curry powder.  Serve with French fries or a crispy bread roll (Brötchen).  Currywurst and fries/Brötchen are served in paper food trays and eaten with currywurst toothpicks.
